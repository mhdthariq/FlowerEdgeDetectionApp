# Edge Detection Application - Update Notes

## Version 0.1.0 - PyQt6 Migration and Initial Setup

### Core Changes

- **GUI Framework**: Migrated from Tkinter to PyQt6 for a more modern and flexible user interface.
- **Styling**: Implemented a basic dark theme using QSS (Qt Style Sheets) for improved visual appeal.
- **Project Structure**: Updated project layout to accommodate PyQt6 and removed obsolete Tkinter-specific files.
- **Build System**:
  - Linux build script (`build_linux_packages.py`) updated to use PyInstaller and `fpm` for PyQt6 application packaging.
  - Initial GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build_and_release.yml`) created for automated Linux builds and releases on version tags.
- **Documentation**: Major updates to `README.md`, `MODULAR_STRUCTURE.md`, `CODE_EXPLANATION.md`, `DISTRIBUTION.md`, and `UI_ENHANCEMENT.md` to reflect the migration to PyQt6 and new build processes.

### UI Improvements

- Main application window redesigned using PyQt6 widgets.
- Image display panels and control buttons laid out using `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`, and `QGridLayout`.
- Added a menu bar for standard actions (File, Process, Help).
- Implemented a status bar for user feedback.
- `QMessageBox` dialogs are now theme-aware for better consistency in dark/light modes.
- Added icons to main action buttons in the toolbar for better visual guidance.

### Functionality Preserved

- Image uploading (JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF).
- Application of Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, and Laplacian edge detection methods.
- Option to apply all methods at once.
- Display of original and processed images.
- Calculation and display of edge pixel count and edge density.
- Saving of processed images.

### Known Issues / TODO

- Windows (`build_windows_exe.py`) and macOS (`build_macos_app.py`) build scripts need to be updated for PyQt6.
- Asset handling (e.g., application icons) in bundled applications needs to be verified and potentially adjusted (e.g., using `sys._MEIPASS`).
- PyQt6 plugin bundling requirements for distributed versions need thorough investigation to ensure full functionality across platforms.
- GitHub Actions workflow needs to be completed for Windows and macOS builds and tested for release asset naming/paths.
- Further UI enhancements to improve overall aesthetics ("make it more beautiful").
- Review and update `USAGE_GUIDE.md` to reflect PyQt6 UI.
