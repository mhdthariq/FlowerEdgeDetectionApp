# Modular Structure - Implementation Guide

This document provides a guide to the modular structure implementation for the Edge Detection Application.

## Overview

The Image Processing application has been refactored into a modular architecture to improve maintainability, readability, and extensibility. The key goals were:

1. Separate concerns into distinct modules
2. Improve code organization
3. Enhance testability
4. Make the codebase more maintainable

## Directory Structure

The application now follows this organized structure:

```
├── main.py                 # Main entry point
├── src/                    # Source code directory
│   ├── app/                # Application logic
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── edge_detection_app.py  # Main application class
│   │   └── main.py         # Application initialization
│   ├── interface/          # User interface components
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── splash_screen.py  # Splash screen implementation
│   │   └── themes.py       # Theme management
│   └── utils/              # Utility functions and classes
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── check_dependencies.py  # Dependency checker
│       ├── edge_detection.py  # Edge detection algorithms
│       └── image_processor.py  # Image processing utilities
├── assets/                 # Image assets and resources
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

## Module Responsibilities

### Main Entry Point (`main.py`)

The root-level `main.py` serves as the primary entry point for the application. It:

- Sets up the Python path to enable package imports
- Configures basic logging
- Provides error handling for application startup
- Imports and calls the `run_app_with_splash` function from the app module

### App Module (`src/app/`)

Contains the core application logic and initialization code.

#### `edge_detection_app.py`

This file contains the `EdgeDetectionApp` class, which is the main application class. It:

- Creates and manages the user interface
- Handles user interactions
- Coordinates between UI and the edge detection utilities
- Manages image loading, processing, and saving

#### `main.py`

This file contains the initialization code for the application:

- Creates the main application window
- Initializes the splash screen
- Creates the application instance
- Handles platform-specific adjustments

### Interface Module (`src/interface/`)

Contains UI-related components that can be reused across the application.

#### `splash_screen.py`

Implements the `SplashScreen` class to display a loading screen while the application starts up. It:

- Shows a branded splash screen
- Displays loading progress messages
- Times out automatically after initialization

#### `themes.py`

Contains the `ThemeSelector` class for managing application themes. It:

- Provides a list of available themes
- Allows changing themes at runtime
- Creates theme menu items

### Utils Module (`src/utils/`)

Contains utility classes and functions that provide core functionality.

#### `edge_detection.py`

Contains the `EdgeDetector` class with implementation of various edge detection algorithms:

- Sobel edge detection
- Prewitt edge detection
- Canny edge detection
- Laplacian edge detection

#### `image_processor.py`

Contains the `ImageProcessor` class with utilities for image handling:

- Loading images from disk
- Resizing images for display
- Converting between image formats
- Saving processed images

#### `check_dependencies.py`

Utility to verify that all required dependencies are available.

## Benefits of the Modular Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific aspect of the application
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to make changes to specific components
3. **Better Testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
4. **Code Reusability**: Utilities can be used across different parts of the app
5. **Clearer Dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicit
6. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly

## Usage Examples

### Running the Application

With the modular structure, the application can be run using the main entry point:

```python
# Run from the root directory
python main.py
```

### Extending the Application

To add a new edge detection algorithm:

1. Add the implementation to `src/utils/edge_detection.py`
2. Update the UI in `src/app/edge_detection_app.py` to include the new method
3. No changes needed to other modules if the interface remains consistent

## Future Directions

The modular structure makes it easier to implement future enhancements:

1. Adding a proper MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
2. Implementing a plugin system for additional algorithms
3. Creating a test suite for each module
4. Adding configuration options for different deployment environments
5. Supporting batch processing of multiple images
